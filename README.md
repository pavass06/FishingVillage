# Fishing Village Economy Simulation

This project simulates a simple economy with only one product—the fish—mimicking the economy of a fishing village.

## 1. Population and Structure
- **Households (FisherMen):** 100 individuals.
- **Firms (FishingFirms):** 5 firms, each employing 18 workers. With 18 workers per firm and 5 firms, the initial employment is set so that about 90% of fishermen are employed and 10% are unemployed.
- **Age Distribution:** FisherMen’s ages are drawn from a normal distribution, N(30, 10).
- **Lifetime:** FisherMen’s lifetimes are drawn from a normal distribution, N(60, 5) – indicating a relatively young population that dies early.
- **Birth Rate:** 0.1 per day (on average, 1 new household every 10 days).
- **Assumption:** All households work (there are no students or retirees).

This README provides an overall view of the simulation’s construction and settings. More detailed documentation for each specific class can be found in the subsequent documents.
